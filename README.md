# dataStructure-database-practice
This project will use various data structures incliding:
  Tree
  Linked Lists 
  Circularly Lingked List 
  
These Data Structures will be populated by user-input data. The input should throw an exception if the input is not valid. 
(it may be a good idea to provide unit tests for each data structure) 

once the data structures have been populated they should then pass the data into a SQL database
